# ðŸ§ª Contributor Testing Checklist

This guide explains how to extend the ingestion pipeline tests when adding new packet subtypes or modifying schema/dispatch logic. Follow this checklist to keep the system **protocolâ€‘faithful, dryâ€‘run safe, and contributorâ€‘friendly**.

## âœ… Steps for Adding a New Subtype

1. **Update Protobuf Schema**
   - Add the new subtype definition in `proto.json`.
   - Confirm it is decoded correctly by `decodeAndNormalize()`.

2. **Extend Schema Validator**
   - In `schemaValidator.js`, add a new entry in `schemaDefinitions`.
   - Define required fields and optional type checks.

3. **Add Dispatch Handler**
   - In `dispatchRegistry.js`, add a new handler function for the subtype.
   - Ensure it calls the correct `insertHandlers` function(s).
   - Optionally emit overlays (`emitOverlay`) or events (`emitEvent`).

4. **Create Fixture**
   - In `test/fixtures/packets.js`, add a canonical encoded buffer for the subtype.
   - Provide a minimal `expected` decoded object for clarity.

5. **Write Unit Tests**
   - In `schemaValidator.test.js`, add tests for valid and invalid cases of the new subtype.
   - Ensure missing required fields are caught.

6. **Write Integration Tests**
   - In `ingestionPipeline.test.js`, add tests that run the decoded object through:
     - `normalizeDecodedPacket()`
     - `validateSubPacket()`
     - `dispatchSubPacket()`
   - Assert that the correct DB inserts, overlays, and events are triggered.

7. **Write Endâ€‘toâ€‘End Tests**
   - In `ingestion.e2e.test.js`, use the raw buffer fixture.
   - Run it through the full pipeline (`decodeAndNormalize â†’ normalizeDecodedPacket â†’ validateSubPacket â†’ dispatchSubPacket`).
   - Assert side effects (DB, overlays, events).

8. **Use Test Helper**
   - In `decodeFixture.js`, add a oneâ€‘liner test using `decodeFixture('yourSubtype', meta, true)`.
   - This ensures consistency across tests.

## ðŸ“˜ Contributor Notes

- **Dryâ€‘Run Safety**: All handlers must log and skip gracefully if required fields are missing.
- **Canonical Fixtures**: Fixtures are the single source of truth for encoded test data.
- **Traceability**: Always assert both DB calls and overlay/event emissions.
- **Extensibility**: Adding a new subtype should never require editing core router logicâ€”only schema, registry, and tests.

By following this checklist, every new subtype is fully covered from **schema â†’ dispatch â†’ DB/overlay/event â†’ tests**, ensuring the ingestion pipeline remains robust, modular, and teachable.
